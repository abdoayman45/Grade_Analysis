## Project Description  
The **Grade Analysis Program** is designed to help users input and analyze students' grades for a single subject.  

### Key Features:  
- **Display** the highest and lowest grades.  
- **Calculate** the average of all grades.  
- **Sort** grades in ascending or descending order.  
- **Highlight** students who scored above the average.  

## What You Will Implement  

### 1. Lists  
- Used to store and manage student grades efficiently.  

### 2. `filter` Function  
- Extracts students with grades above a specific threshold or average.  

### 3. `map` Function  
- Applies transformations to grades (e.g., adding extra points to each grade).  

### 4. `sort` and `reverse` Functions  
- Sorts grades in ascending or descending order for easy analysis.  

### 5. List Comprehension  
- Creates a list of students and their grades in a single, concise line.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  students = [{'Name': 'Ali', 'Grade': 85}, {'Name': 'Sara', 'Grade': 92}]
